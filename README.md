# Cohort Analysis - Weekly Subscriptions Retention

## Introduction

In this cohort analysis, we explore the retention rates of weekly subscriptions over a 6-week period. The analysis focuses on tracking the percentage of subscribers who remained active in the weeks following their initial subscription.

## Data and Assumptions

The analysis is based on weekly subscription data.

The analysis is conducted as of 2021-02-07.

Data is sourced from the turing_data_analytics.subscriptions table.

## Results

The cohort analysis reveals the retention rates for each weekly cohort from week 0 (initial subscription) to week 6. Here are the results:

## Insights

1. **Initial Drop in Retention**: In the first three weeks, the retention rate was consistently 90% or less, indicating a significant number of users churning shortly after subscribing.

2. **Improvement in Retention**: Starting from week 3, there is a noticeable increase in retention rates, reaching almost 95% in the 6th week. This suggests that some of the issues leading to early churn may have been resolved.

### Possible Reasons for Early Churn

- **User Interface**: Users may not have liked the platform's interface, impacting their decision to continue.
- **Product-Customer Fit**: The product may not align well with the customer's needs or expectations.
- **Onboarding Process**: Ineffective onboarding processes might not have provided users with a smooth introduction to the product.
- **Customer Service**: Poor customer service can lead to dissatisfaction and churn.
- **Value Proposition**: Users may not have perceived sufficient value from the product.
- **Bugs**: Unresolved product bugs could hinder the user experience.
- **Payment Issues**: Failed payment methods can result in subscription cancellations.
- **Feature Availability**: A lack of essential features and functionalities might deter users from continuing their subscriptions.


## Recommendations

- **User Interface Enhancements**: Continuously improve the platform's interface to enhance user experience and satisfaction.
- **Customer-Centric Approach**: Ensure the product aligns with the customers' needs and preferences. Gather feedback and make necessary adjustments.
- **Effective Onboarding**: Optimize the onboarding process to ensure users get the most out of the product from the start.
- **Quality Customer Support**: Provide top-notch customer service to address issues promptly and effectively.
- **Deliver Value**: Communicate and demonstrate the value of the product to users.
- **Bug Resolution**: Quickly address and resolve product bugs to prevent user frustration.
- **Payment Support**: Offer multiple payment options and ensure that payment methods work seamlessly.
- **Feature Expansion**: Continually develop and add new features to meet user demands and expectations.

## Recommendations for Further Churn Analysis

- **Churn Segmentation**: Segment users based on their churn behavior. Identify different user groups such as high-value customers, infrequent users, or those who canceled due to technical issues. This allows for more targeted strategies to reduce churn within each segment.
- **User Feedback**: Collect user feedback through surveys, interviews, or direct communication to understand why they canceled their subscriptions. Qualitative insights can be invaluable for making data-driven decisions.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Develop predictive models to forecast which users are at the highest risk of churning. Utilize machine learning techniques to identify early warning signs of churn and take proactive measures.
- **A/B Testing**: Conduct A/B testing to evaluate the impact of changes or enhancements on churn rates. Experiment with different strategies and monitor their effectiveness in reducing churn.
- **CLV Analysis**: Analyze the Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) of users who churned compared to those who remained. This can provide insights into the potential revenue loss due to churn and help in devising strategies to increase CLV.
- **Cohort Analysis Over Time**: Extend cohort analysis over a more extended time frame to observe long-term trends in churn. This may reveal seasonality or changing patterns in user behavior.
- **User Journey Mapping**: Map the user journey from acquisition to churn. Understand key touchpoints, barriers, and opportunities for improvement throughout the user lifecycle.
- **Communication Strategy**: Evaluate the effectiveness of communication strategies for re-engaging churned users. Test different reactivation campaigns, email sequences, and incentives to win back lost customers.
- **Competitive Analysis**: Study the competitive landscape to identify reasons why users may be choosing alternatives. Understanding the strengths and weaknesses of competitors can guide product enhancements.
- **Customer Support and Training**: Assess the quality of customer support and training resources. Enhance support channels, create self-help resources, and offer training sessions to improve the user experience.
- **Data Enrichment**: Combine subscription data with additional data sources to gain deeper insights. Incorporate data on user demographics, geography, or behavior to create a more comprehensive picture of churn drivers.
- **Feedback Loop**: Implement a feedback loop for continuous improvement. Regularly revisit and adjust strategies based on new insights and user feedback to maintain a low churn rate.

By conducting a more in-depth churn analysis, you can pinpoint the specific areas and user segments that need attention and implement tailored strategies to reduce churn effectively.

## Conclusion
The analysis demonstrates the importance of tracking and improving retention rates, especially during the early stages of a subscription. By addressing user concerns and providing a better user experience, it is possible to retain more subscribers over time.
